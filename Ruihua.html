                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">"Ruihua Tai Chi Association" was established on the first anniversary</br>
                                    For many overseas Chinese in a foreign country, faced with increasing job competition and life pressure, the pace of life is accelerating, and many people have varying degrees of depression and anxiety. Everyone is looking for a fitness method that suits them to relieve daily stress. Among them, Tai Chi, a treasure in traditional Chinese culture, is a clear stream. In addition to being a fitness exercise, it is also a kind of martial arts exercise. Not only can Taijiquan cultivate our temperament, adjust our psychology, help us relieve psychological discomfort, but also strengthen our body and self-defense! Recently, many studies have found that practicing Tai Chi can improve balance, leg strength, cardiovascular endurance, pulse rate, muscle flexibility, immune system response, sleep habits, well-being, self-worth, and the ability to focus and multitask on cognitive tests.
                                </br></br>In order to better carry forward Chinese traditional culture, give full play to the role of Ruihua Chinese School as a community service platform, and enrich the activities of Chinese people in the western suburbs of Chicago, at the request of Tai Chi enthusiasts, with the assistance of Yamei Education and Culture Center, Ruihua Tai Chi Association It was officially established on September 14, 2019. The association is a part of Ruihua's adult activities and is managed by the Ruihua School Committee. The first president is Ms. Li Chang, the executive director of the Hualian Association and the director of the Yamei Education and Culture Center.
The purpose of "Ruihua Tai Chi Association" is to invite Tai Chi masters to give lectures from time to time to improve the level of members and enhance mutual friendship; progress; and through real on-site demonstrations to help Tai Chi fans in the Chicago area to deeply understand the cultural connotation of Chinese martial arts, so as to further promote the spread and promotion of Chinese traditional culture overseas.
                                </br></br>
Fortunately, the "Ruihua Tai Chi Association" invited Mr. Ouyang Weiling, a famous Tai Chi master from Guangdong, to come to the school for guidance at the beginning of its establishment. Teacher Ouyang (picture 1-3) is a sixth-dan Chinese martial arts, a national social sports instructor, a provincial first-level referee, and a third-level referee.
